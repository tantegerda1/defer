Purpose
=======

Provides interface definition and code fragments to help creating objects that need to be "paused" until some later point in time.
This package is meant to be run as extension inside a TYPO3 CMS instance. Other (e.g. extension-) code can then use the interface and implementations from this package.


Warning
=======

This is beta-state software. Its class and method signatures might still change. As soon as things have settled enough, a proper major version will be released.



Thanks
======

The TYPO3 community for putting so much effort into developing, managing and sharing a great product.
